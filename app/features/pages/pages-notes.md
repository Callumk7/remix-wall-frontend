# Where should actions go?

A decent question. How can we reuse database logic. It makes sense to keep actions as close to their forms, but we want to have uniform behaviour as much as possible. I guess we have the `infer type` type that we can use as arguements for wrapper functions, and use these through the app. Where then should these be filed?

I will work on some practical examples, and then get into the nitty gritty here.
